A simple restaurant page, suggested on [ The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-restaurant-page), to practice dynamic rendering of the page contents. This project implements a 'tab' navigation between important sections. The main goal was to practice using the module pattern and using Webpack for bundling as well as asset management-- in this project I use webpack to load the font and images.
